# Blockchain Credential Verification with ERC-721 

## 📌 Overview
This project built a **secure credential verification system** using **ERC-721 NFTs (non-fungible tokens)**. The goal was to create **tamper-proof, verifiable academic/skill credentials** on the blockchain.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Solidity, Ethereum (ERC-721 standard)
- Frontend with JavaScript/React
- Deployment using web3 frameworks

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Developed ERC-721 smart contracts for unique credentials
2. Integrated frontend to interact with blockchain
3. Designed end-to-end credential minting & verification flow
4. Tested deployments in Ropsten/Testnet environments

## 📊 Results
- Successfully issued and verified credentials on-chain
- Seamless frontend integration for user verification
- Demonstrated application of NFTs beyond collectibles

## 🌟 Applications
- Academic certificates
- Digital identity solutions
- Professional licensing and proof of skill
